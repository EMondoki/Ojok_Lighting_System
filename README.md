# Remote Controlled Lighting System
### Submitted by Ojok Erick Mondoki

## Overview
This project implements a remote-controlled lighting system using an ESP32-WROOM-32 to control three LEDs (Red, Green, Blue) via a web dashboard. The schematic is designed in EasyEDA, and the code is written for Arduino IDE.

## How to Use
1. Build the circuit per the schematic (Schematic_Erick_Systems_2025-07-21).
2. Upload `remote_lighting_system.ino` to the ESP32 using Arduino IDE.
3. Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud) to get the ESP32’s IP address.
4. Access the dashboard via a browser (e.g., http://192.168.10.1).
5. Use the ON/OFF buttons to control the LEDs.
